# SNG Landing Page

Landing page for an app built in React, Gatsby and TailwindCSS. The purpose of this project has been to experiment with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/), an animation library for React.

The page contains subtle animations when the sections are viewed for the first time, some of which have been made animating SVG elements directly.

From this project I:
- Practiced manipulating SVG assets.
- Got familiar with how to create complex, coordinated animations in React.
- Practiced implementing an existing design from scratch into a codebase of my own.

You can view the final result [here](https://sng-landing.netlify.app/).
